## React Roadmap
1. Core of React (State or UI manipulation, JSX)
2. Component Reusability
3. Reusing of component (props or properties)
4. How to propagate change (hooks)

## Additional Add-On
1. Router (React don't have Router) -> React Router DOM
2. State management (React don't have state management) -> Redux, Redux toolkit, context API
3. Class based component -> legacy code
4. BAAS Apps -> Social media clone, E-commerce, etc.
